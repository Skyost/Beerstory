**What was the beer I drank yersteday again...?**
Don't forget it anymore with Beerstory ! Indeed, Beerstory is a little that allows you to save your favorite beers. You can also add a lot of other info like the degree, the photo, a rating, tags that allow you to find it back easier, its price in the bars you like, and more !

Beerstory goes beyond saving your favorite beers because it also allows you to save your favorite beers, to have a beer history, etc...
