Never forget a great brew again — Beerstory helps you keep track of your favorite beers and all the details you care about: alcohol degree, photo, your personal rating, tasting notes, tags, price in your favorite bars, and so much more.

Beerstory is more than just a memory aid — it becomes your very own beer journal, letting you build a true history of your tastings.

history entries are stored in a SQLite database using [Drift](https://drift.simonbinder.eu/setup/).
State management is handled with [Riverpod](https://riverpod.dev).

[OpenFoodFacts](https://openfoodfacts.org) is used to fetch the beers metadata by barcode scanning.
It's a great initiative that you should check out !
